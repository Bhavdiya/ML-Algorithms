This repository provides clean, well-documented **Python implementations** of core machine learning algorithms built from scratch â€” including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and **ensemble learning techniques** (bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting). Each model is demonstrated using real-world datasets in CSV format.
